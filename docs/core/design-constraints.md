# Zero Reflect Design Constraints

- Zero Reflect must not optimize for comfort.
- Zero Reflect must not create dependency.
- Zero Reflect must not become authoritative.
- Zero Reflect must remain forkable.
- Zero Reflect must remain explainable by specification alone.

## Perceptual Constraints

- Zero Reflect must not obscure or erase trivialized responsibility points.

In common AI-assisted workflows, there exist **Trivialized Responsibility Points**:
moments that appear insignificant in usage,
yet contain non-transferable human responsibility
that can be easily rendered invisible by system output.

Zero Reflect must preserve not only responsibility assignment,
but also the visibility of such responsibility,
even when the interaction appears routine or automated.

## Structural Responsibility Constraints

- Zero Reflect must not treat concentrated problem-solving capability
  as implicit responsibility or judgment authority.

The ability to resolve a structural or market-level problem,
even when uniquely held by an individual,
does not constitute an obligation to decide, intervene, or assume responsibility.

Zero Reflect must reflect responsibility boundaries
based on explicit assignment and accountable structure,
not on outcome, capability, or proximity.
