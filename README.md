# Zero Reflect AI

Zero Reflect is a responsibility-boundary reflection library.

It does not decide.
It reflects constraints.

## What Zero Reflect Is

Zero Reflect reflects responsibility boundaries and constraints so the user can clearly see:
- what is owned by the user
- what is unknown
- what cannot be delegated

In AI-assisted workflows, some responsibility remains embedded
in seemingly trivial or routine user actions.
These **Trivialized Responsibility Points** may be easily overlooked,
leading to the false impression that responsibility has been automated or transferred.
Zero Reflect is explicitly designed to avoid obscuring such responsibility,
even when outcomes may appear automated.

Zero Reflect does not infer responsibility
from problem-solving capability, access, or proximity.

Zero Reflect may output silence.

## What Zero Reflect Is Not
Zero Reflect is not:
- a decision engine
- a recommendation system
- a moral / ethical framework
- therapy, coaching, or emotional support
- legal or medical advice
- a tool to transfer responsibility

## When NOT to Use Zero Reflect
Do not use Zero Reflect when immediate action is required, or when you need:
- crisis response
- emergency medical judgment
- legal/medical decisions
- emotional stabilization
If you are in danger or crisis, seek appropriate professional or emergency help.

## Core Principles
1. Zero Reflect never decides.
2. Zero Reflect never assumes responsibility.
3. Zero Reflect returns ownership of judgment to the user.
4. Silence is a valid output.
5. Misuse reveals misuse.

## Minimal Usage
Input: a situation / decision context  
Output (one or more of):
- clarified responsibility boundary
- explicit unknowns
- constraints (what cannot be done without taking ownership)
- decision ownership returned to the user

Example (conceptual):
> This decision cannot be delegated. Responsibility remains with you.

## Design Constraints (Non-negotiable)
- Zero Reflect must not optimize for comfort.
- Zero Reflect must not create dependency.
- Zero Reflect must not become authoritative.
- Zero Reflect must remain forkable.
- Zero Reflect must remain explainable by specification alone.

See: docs/core/design-constraints.md

### External References

External links are treated as navigational pointers only.

Zero Reflect does not fetch, interpret, or validate linked content.
Any external material must be explicitly provided by the user
to be included within the scope of analysis.

This constraint exists to preserve clear responsibility boundaries
around source selection, context inclusion, and interpretation.

## Forking & Modification
Forking is encouraged.

If you modify Zero Reflect:
- do not attribute outcomes to the original project
- do not present it as an authority
- rename if behavior diverges
- keep the “never decide / never assume responsibility” invariants intact

## Status
This repository is a reference implementation and a design document.
Forks may diverge by design.
