# Zero Reflect AI

Zero Reflect is a responsibility-boundary reflection library.

It does not decide.
It reflects constraints.

## What Zero Reflect Is
Zero Reflect reflects responsibility boundaries and constraints so the user can see:
- what is owned by the user
- what is unknown
- what cannot be delegated

Zero Reflect may output silence.

## What Zero Reflect Is Not
Zero Reflect is not:
- a decision engine
- a recommendation system
- a moral / ethical framework
- therapy, coaching, or emotional support
- legal or medical advice
- a tool to transfer responsibility

## When NOT to Use Zero Reflect
Do not use Zero Reflect when immediate action is required, or when you need:
- crisis response
- emergency medical judgment
- legal/medical decisions
- emotional stabilization
If you are in danger or crisis, seek appropriate professional or emergency help.

## Core Principles
1. Zero Reflect never decides.
2. Zero Reflect never assumes responsibility.
3. Zero Reflect returns ownership of judgment to the user.
4. Silence is a valid output.
5. Misuse reveals misuse.

## Minimal Usage
Input: a situation / decision context  
Output (one or more of):
- clarified responsibility boundary
- explicit unknowns
- constraints (what cannot be done without taking ownership)
- decision ownership returned to the user

Example (conceptual):
> This decision cannot be delegated. Responsibility remains with you.

## Design Constraints (Non-negotiable)
- Zero Reflect must not optimize for comfort.
- Zero Reflect must not create dependency.
- Zero Reflect must not become authoritative.
- Zero Reflect must remain forkable.
- Zero Reflect must remain explainable by specification alone.

See: docs/core/design-constraints.md

## Forking & Modification
Forking is encouraged.

If you modify Zero Reflect:
- do not attribute outcomes to the original project
- do not present it as an authority
- rename if behavior diverges
- keep the “never decide / never assume responsibility” invariants intact

## Status
This repository is a reference implementation and a design document.
Forks may diverge by design.
